# UC Davis Data Science Club Projects and Workshops

## Overview
This repository contains a group project and workshops I co-led for the Davis Data Science Club.

### 1. Credit Card Fraud Project
- **File:** `Credit Card Fraud Project.ipynb`
- **Description:** Using a machine learning model to identify fradulent credit card cases. This project was a collaborative effort with Ru Han Wang.
  - Loads a pickled DataFrame containing transaction data and prepares it for analysis.
  - Handles missing values by replacing them with the mean of each respective column to ensure data completeness.
  - Plots categorical feature distributions such as 'DeviceType' to understand their distribution across fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions.
  - Uses a Decision Tree classifier to predict fraud based on transaction attributes.
  - Computes and displays key performance metrics such as accuracy, AUC score, confusion matrix, and classification report to assess model effectiveness.
  - Visualizes the ROC curve and Precision-Recall curve to illustrate the classifier's performance in distinguishing between fraud and non-fraud transactions.
- **File:** `Credit Card Fraud Presentation.pptx`
- **Description:** Presentation that I gave to the club to explain my findings
  - Went over visualizations to explain data
  - Feature engineering and frequency encoding explanation fro decision tree
  - model accuracy and results inlduing hyperparameter improvements

### 2. Data Visualization Workshop
- **File:** `Data Visualization Workshop.ipynb`
- **Description:** Teaching how to do data visualization in R and Python. Collaborative effort with Apoorva Hooda and Steven Ha
  - Goes over different plots in ggplot2
  - Goes over matplotlib
  - Goes over seaborn
- **File:** `Data Visualization Workshop.pptx`
